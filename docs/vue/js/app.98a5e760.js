Fortunately Vue.js provides a way to pass properties to the component. Very similar to the way we define data inside component we are defining a properties that are passed to the component. To do that we will use <code>props: [...]</code> property. In a basic example it is a property that has an array of strings. Each of those strings is a property name that could be passed into the component. But there is also a way to define a properties as an object. In that case we have to define the property name as a key and the type of that property as a value. </p><label>Props.vue</label>',5),we=Object(o["f"])("p",null," Because attributes names in HTML are case-insensitive it doesn't matter if we use in our template camleCased prop names or kebab-cased equivalents.

To use a child component in the parent we have to import it from the origin place and add register that component in the <code>components: {...}</code> property of Parent. Now we can use this props to pass the string value to the child component. </p><h3> Passing Variables </h3><p> Regarding passing a Static variables we can pass a value that could be any type of data. To inform the Vue instance that we want to pass a variable as a value of property we have to use the <code>v-bind</code> directive. Directives are powerful special attributes provided by Vue.js that allow us perform reactive behavior on the DOM. Every Vue.js directive is prefixed with <code>v-</code>. In the example below we are passing a variable as a value of property using <code>v-bind:welcomeMessage</code>. </p><label>Parent.vue</label>",4),Oe=Object(o["d"])("<p> Some of the Vue.js directives has a shorthand version. In that case we can use just<code>:</code> (colon) to indicate that we want to pass a variable as a value of property (<code>:welcomeMessage</code>, so we reduced the <code>v-bind</code> text). We have to remember that we should not change the recived value from parent inside the child component. </p><h2> Emmiting Events </h2><p> Communication from child to parent is much easier than providing a props into the component. That works on the same principle like in many other frameworks. We can emit an event from the child to the parent that could handle that action. To emit a such event we neet to use the <code>$emit()</code> method from core Vue.js instance. As the argument we pass the name of the event and the data that will be transfered. Now only the parent have to listen for that event and handle it. To do that we have to use the <code>v-on</code> directive on a specific event name for that component. For that directive there is also a shorthand version so v-on: can be replaced by <code>@</code> (at) sign. </p><label>SingleEmit.vue</label>",4),ye=Object(o["f"])("p",null,[Object(o["e"])(" The thing that we can see is the new property for our Vue.js component.

Unlike in Angular documentation in Vue directives are not directly named and divided to specific structural or attribute directives. But nothing stands in the way of using them. Directives are special attributes with the <code>v-</code> prefix that expect a single JavaScript expression as a value. If that value changes the Vue.js engine will apply the changes to the element regarding the directive. One of the most common directive in Vue is <code>v-bind</code> that is used to bind any data or property to the element because mustaches cannot be used inside HTML attributes. The second one that we have seen is the <code>v-on</code> directive that is used to listening the DOM events. </p><h2>Build-in attribute directives</h2><p> Using that concept we can bind any data to specific elements to manipulate them. Very often we need to manipulate the element class list or its inline styles so to do that in Vue.js we can attach the <code>v-bind</code> directive to the proper attribute. In our expression we only need to generate the final string value that we want to bind to the element. </p><h3>v-bind:class</h3><p> Attaching the v-bind directive to the class attribute will inform the Vue.js that we want to bind the class attribute to the result of our expression.

This time we used the array syntax instead of object to define the classes. If we do it in this way we can also bind the CSS classes result to the data property of the component. Very often to write a clean code we can combine that directive with &quot;computed&quot; property where all the logic is placed and returns a string class name. </p><h3>v-bind:style</h3><p> The same syntax works for the style attribute.

Isn&#39;t it? </p><h3>Attribute directives shorthand</h3><p> The <code>v-</code> prefix is a identification for Vue.js attributes that are in the template. But sometimes we work on the project where every template is managed by Vue so we can reduce the amount of code by using the shorthand. </p><ul><li><code>v-bind:href</code> =&gt; <code>:href</code> - we reduce the whole v-bind closure </li><li><code>v-on:click</code> =&gt; <code>@click</code>- we replace that directive with a &quot;@&quot; symbol </li></ul><h2>Build-in structural directives</h2><p> In Vue.js we can conditionally render a specific HTML elements depenging on the result of the structural directive expression. This directives can modify the DOM structure by adding or removing elements. </p><h3>v-if</h3><p> The v-if directive is used to conditionally render or not a specific HTML block. If the condition expression returns a truthy value the specific code block will be rendered. Otherwise the block will be removed. This directive is a nice guard against the null value.

Vuex is a state management pattern for Vue.js applications.

In this pattern the "state" is the single source of truth that handles all the data. View components can map the state to the local variables and display the data.

Well, the answer is simple. If our application is growing larger and larger, and the components relationships are becoming more complex, we need to make sure that the valid data is being shared between the components. This is where Vuex comes in. We don\'t need to worry about the passing props and synchronizing the data between the components.
